                  SEDI RWANDA has created by a team of development activists whose mission is mainly related to contributing to the empowerment of rural poorest and most vulnerable families, with special focus on single mothers families and the historically marginalized community so that they can be fully integrated in social economic development and become actors and victors of a positive change for sustainable development.
                </p>
                <p

  SEDI Rwanda believes in community works against disempowerment, social isolation and discrimination of most vulnerable family classes as powerful tool for social change.

                <p
                >
                  Sedi Rwanda believes that systemic change starts with vulnerable themselves taking the deliberate decision to join an “Anti-violence solidarity clubs” in their neighborhood, where they meet to share life stories and experiences, heal and support each other, receive motivational counsel, work together through “income generating activity” program, and save together to reclaim their dignity.
                </p>
                <p
                >
                 Solidarity clubs must extend beyond the most vulnerable to supporting families and the community at large. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Sedi Rwanda’ s cultural village and traditional knowledge programmes avails itself as a channel for people of compassion to demonstrate their love and care to beneficiaries and their children. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Sedi Rwanda also believes the vicious circle of poorest families can be broken if the community come together to raise awareness and take preventive measures to protect the youth against it.

                  in clean uniforms, with school materials, no problems of
                  parents’ contribution fees, so children in Masoro village are

                  The SEDI RWANDA program has set up the system of empowering
                  the beneficiaries in Masoro and Cyaruzinge villages with
                  management skills of the opportunities they have got.</li>

                  <li>In
                  Masoro village SEDI RWANDA provided training on management and
                  thought to train them on mushroom farming , as a business
                  activity which SEDI RWANDA has elaborated for those
                  beneficiaries to replace the (stoves making project) which has
                  been stopped because, actually Masoro is Trading Zone and no
                  one who is allowed to use the swamp of the clay. In fact, the
                  beneficiaries are kindly contextualized to this program
                  planned for their promotion and are in full understanding of
                  their role and responsibility. The commonly useful system in
                  this issue of mindset of change is the village meetings,
                  seminars and trainings.</li><li> The village meetings with the
                  historically marginalized community members and local
                  authorities is monthly planned to sensitize the local
                  community to take action in development process. Community
                  sensitization process is an important activity that has great
                  effects for the beneficiaries. Specifically, the activities
                  have impacted the behaviours of many community members for the
                  better.</li>
